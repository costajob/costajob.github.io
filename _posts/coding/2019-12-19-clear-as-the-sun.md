These are the last keystrokes on my corporate MacBook. Next week i will move to another company, another city, another life.

I started my career with an internship as a web designer within a small agency. At the beginning we were few people, just the stakeholders and me.

At that time everyone was multi-tasking, things need to get done quickly and knowing how doing them was the exception. More often you have the opportunity to learn something new. It was challenging, quite stressing and incredibly exciting.

Back to the present.

I am quitting a consultancy corporate where i spent almost eight years of my career. I started as an *architect*, worked as a service manager and finished the journey as a *plain* software developer.

The goods of consultancy is that you can change hat frequently, working with different customers, on different projects, in different industries.
The main drawback is that you'll end up with being pretty good at everything, but excelling in nothing.

Coding is similar to writing prose: your code tells a story, the way you'll write it has impacts both on editors, publishers and readers.

I consider myself a polyglot programmer, nonetheless i just excel in few languages. Not all programming languages are the same, you know exactly once you'll grab one that suits you, since your story flows like a stream.

Indeed i was quite happy when a *big* consultancy company made me an offer.  
This was part of the plan i was *programmed* to follow: getting a solid job, climbing the organization chart, earning more money, buying a house, getting married, having children and living happily ever after.

It was a broken plan, for me at least.

That's why after almost fifteen years i am jumping back on a startup, trading power for freedom, ambition for creativity, safeness for thrills. 

The future is quite uncertain, but clear as the sun as well.
