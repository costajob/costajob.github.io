These are the last keystrokes on the keyboard of my corporate MacBook Pro. 
Next week i will move to another company, another city, another life.

I started my career back in 1998, with an internship as a web designer within a small agency. At the beginning we were five people, four stakeholders and me.

At that time everyone was multi-tasking, things need to get done quickly and knowing how doing them was the exception. More often you have the opportunity to learn something new. It was challenging, very stressing and incredibly exciting.

Back to the present.

I am quitting from a big consultancy corporate, where i spent almost eight years of my life. I entered as an *architect*, worked as a service manager and finished the journey as a *plain* software developer.

After all, the goods of consultancy is that you can change hats easily, working for different customers, on different projects, in different industries.
The main drawback is that you'll end being a generalist: pretty good at everything, excellent in nothing.

I consider coding like writing prose. Your code tells a story: the way you'll write it has impacts both on the editors, the publishers and the readers.

I consider myself a polyglot programmer, nonetheless i just excel in few languages. Not all programming languages are the same, you know exactly once you'll grab your favorite, it's when your story flows like a stream.

Indeed i was happy accepting my first job for a big company. I like the idea to work for a safe employer and upgrade my position on its organization chart.

At least this was part the plan i was *suggested* to follow: get a solid job, earning more money, buying a house, get married, have children and living happily forever after.

This was a broken plan, for me at least.

That's why after almost fifteen year i am jumping back on a startup, trading-off power for freedom, ambition for creativity, safeness for thrills. 

The future is quite uncertain, but clear as the sun.
