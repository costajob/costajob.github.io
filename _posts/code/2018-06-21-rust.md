Recently i am delving inside the Rust programming language, an experience leaving me with a strange mix of enthusiasm and skepticism.

The learning curve is very tough: in order to grasp the ownership model that makes Rust pretty unique, you have to stretch your mind for rules you normally ignore in other programming languages.

I suggest you to check first on the second edition of the official online book, which is now much better than the first edition, and then pointing straight to the excellent O’Reilly book, that covers all the language twirls in much more details (but requires more focus).

Aside from its unique memory model, Rust comes with advanced type inference, immutability by default, structs and enums (to which attach methods), traits (concrete interfaces), flexible closures (lambdas) and safe (courtesy of its ownership model) parallelism by different paradigms (which doesn’t include green threads).

The language is growing with mature, production-ready (external) libraries and can be a good alternative to C and C++ for system programming, but can also tread on GO, Python and Ruby feet, at least once you get used to its borrowing rules.

But there’s more: Rust is a GC free language and has minimal memory footprint, meaning it can be embedded within other (slower) runtimes when CPU-bound is top notch.

If you are serious about programming and not scared to learn something completely new (or if you are simply stressed by nuisances of C and C++), do yourself a favour and check Rust language out!
