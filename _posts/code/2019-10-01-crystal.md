I discovered Crystal back in 2012, when the language was still in its embryonic state: an admirable tentative to write an ahead of time compiled version of Ruby.

At that time the language was barely complete, since the standard library lacks any useful abstractions and building tools.

I met with Crystal again in 2016, finding a pretty mature language offering one of the best type inference I've seen on a strong typed language.

I enjoyed porting some of my Ruby gems to Crystal, being stroked by the effortless experience. So easy in fact that it became my first option to replace Ruby on CPU-bound heavy duties.

At the time of this writing Crystal has just reached a milestone release (0.31.1): the core library is stable and feature complete, package management and tools are usable, the compiler is fast and some interesting frameworks are emerging.

Crystal (small) team just introduced parallelism support via multi-threading, implemented on top of SCP (inspired by GO) and i am glad the first [benchmarks](https://github.com/costajob/app-servers) are really promising.

At the end Crystal greatly reduces the impedance mismatch for programmers used to the freedom of duck typing, combining blazing performance with joy of use. Not bad considering you have to sacrifice one or the other when picking any other programming language.
