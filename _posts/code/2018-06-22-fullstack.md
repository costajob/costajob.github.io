I started my professional career back in 1998, after taking a course named Internet Multimedia Publishing.

The course tried to cover many topics at once: from plain HTML/CSS, to Photoshop/Illustrator design and even Java programmingâ€¦

Useless to say that course produced no programmers, nonetheless it opened the doors of some interesting internships (indeed i remained seven years on mine).

Thinking of me at that time i was much more than what is now considered a fullstack developer: i did not only HTML/CSS templating, JavaScript/JScript programming, but also Photoshop designing, contents authoring  and customer caring.

That experience helped me to grow, indeed when i moved to a consultancy agency to code by Java for a big Telco company, everyone was impressed by my fullstack abilities.

But, was i that good at programming in Java/JavaScript, doing HTML/CSS templating and designing by Photoshop? I hardly doubt so.

Some years ago, when i decided to delve inside Ruby and, more in general, in object oriented design, i just discovered how my know-how was limited (and i was considered a senior).

The point is: fullstack roles make sense for small startups, where you code side by side with the founders (as i did), but corporates asking for fullstack are nonesense.

Bear with me, every programmer should know a little bit of HTML/CSS and DOM scripting, but a professional should focus on one topic (as big as programming) in order to provide the best solution.

This is particularly true on these days, where front-end programming is much more than HTML/CSS templating and the JavaScript frameworks pop up like spring flowers.
