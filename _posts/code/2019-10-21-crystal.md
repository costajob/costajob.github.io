I discovered Crystal back in 2012, when the language was still in its embryonic state: an admirable tentative to write an ahead of time compiled version of Ruby.

At that time the language was barely complete: the standard library lacks any useful abstractions and building tools.

I met with Crystal again in 2016, finding a mature language offering static (duck) typing and blazing performance.

I also ported some of my Ruby gems to Crystal and was stroked by the effortless experience. So easy in fact that Crystal became my first choice for replacing CPU-bound Ruby code, much better than GO or Elixir.

At the time of this writing Crystal has just reached a milestone release (0.31.1): the core library is stable and feature complete, package management and tools are there, the compiler is fast and some interesting frameworks are emerging.

Crystal also supports parallelism via multi-threading, implemented on top of SCP (inspired by GO): the feature has just been added as experimental, but the first [benchmarks](https://github.com/costajob/app-servers) are promising.

The (few) guys behind Crystal did a titanic job creating a mature, AOT language, that reduces the impedance mismatch for programmers used to the freedom allowed by the duck typing approach.

It is time to start paying back by using Crystal on your next project, you will not be disappointed.
