My name is Mike.

If you land to this site from LinkedIn, you're probably looking for one of my programming posts.

Feel free to disagree with me (i enjoy that), since all of the content you'll read are pretty opinionated.

Now and then i enjoy writing rhymes with my native language, you can read them in the dedicated section of the site.
